This data is for adiabatically switching the drive. 

From 0 to F=0.5 as F(t) = \alpha t, where \alpha =0.001

Then, after drive fully switched on:
Time evolve from tf = F/(\alpha) to tf+30
During this interval (30) compute results and the outcome here is the average. 

first row is density
second row is sz_n*sz_{n+1} correlation
third row is s+_n*s-_{n+1} correlation

each file is marked with the corresponding mu for J=1
