This data is for adiabatically switching the drive in the following way: 

From 0 to F=0.5 as F(t) = \alpha t, where \alpha =0.001 at mu = 5

Then, after drive fully switched on, we do two things 
 - Ramp mu towards zero with dt = 0.1 as mu = 5 - \alpha t 
 - For the given values of mu, we make a deepcopy of psi
 - evolve this deepcopy with mu and F constants for time interval (30)
 - calculate the output quantities over this interval (30)
 - Average the output quantity at the end and save them in the file here. 

first row is density
second row is sz_n*sz_{n+1} correlation
third row is s+_n*s-_{n+1} correlation

each file is marked with the corresponding mu for J=1 and N = 40
