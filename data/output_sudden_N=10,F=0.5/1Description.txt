This is sharp switching of the drive: constant H evolution

F = 0.5, J = 1, and value of mu indicated by file name as "mui" meaning: mu=i/10

Value of N is in the folder name. 

Time evolution is done from t=0 to tf=50 

Results evaluated starting at t=20 to t=50 with 0.1 time step.

The outcome here is the average of these results.

Row1: density
Row2: sz two point correlations
Row3: sx two point correlations
Row4: sy two point correlations
Row5: sz three point correlations 

sx and sy where used to compute (s+)(s-)
